          I made up my mind in high school that I would pursue a business degree. Being from Guelph, I decided to stay in the city for my post-secondary education. 
          My first two years were uneventful in terms of my technical skill progress, but I was having fun like any young university student would.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I was very skilled in Excel and at the time that seemed to be 90% of the software a business student would need to know. 
          Although I was aware of programming languages like Python and C++, I never considered learning and I never had to. In second year, 
          I had to use R and it was cool at the time, but I found it difficult to learn (those error messages are brutal). 
          Other than that, I just stuck with Excel, it's still my bread and butter!

          My Excel skills helped in securing my first co-op at RBC. During my time at the bank, I was working alongside another co-op named Garrett. 
          He was a year older and much more technically capable because he knew VBA. 
          While hardcore programmers laugh at the thought of VBA, it really is a programming language!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The entire financial system runs on Excel, so in most cases VBA is one of the only tools you have at your disposal. 
          When I saw what Garrett was able to do with VBA, I was shocked. 
          My time working with Garrett opened my eyes to what other tools exist and all the amazing things you can do with them.

          You would think by now I would be grinding VBA in my free time, not quite. Most of my 2021 was spent working on the next unicorn app (it was a dumb idea in hindsight). 
          My team had a technical co-founder, so I could stick with the sales and business side of the venture. Well, he left, and my team was clueless on how to proceed. 
          As you could imagine, we let the idea die off. I was bummed at how dependent I was on somebody else to bring my ideas to life; I couldn't even build an MVP.
          This was a key learning of 2021.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          In the summer I went back to the same role at RBC. With the help of my team, I was able to secure my final 8-month co-op term in a nearby department. 
          I really wanted to make an impact in my new role, so I spent Christmas break of 2021 working on my VBA skills through online tutorials and 
          replicating some of the VBA work I saw in my last role.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I was having so much fun with VBA that I decided that in 2022 I would learn how to code. 
          I'm a problem solver at heart; this would be another tool to make my life at work easier and help bring all my crazy ideas to life.

          So, this is the year where it all went into overdrive. I got settled into my new job and started automating everything with VBA. 
          Every day after work I would spend hours on completing CS50 by Harvard to understand the fundamentals of programming. 
          Using my newfound knowledge, I started using Python to automate even more tasks at work. I started my work term in January, and by March all my tasks were automated!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          CS50 was amazing, so I jumped into CS50W which focused on web development. I was good with Django, but I couldn't understand JavaScript. 
          I took a step back and switched to The Odin Project. Following The Odin Project helped me regain my confidence and finally understand how to traverse the DOM using JavaScript.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          In the summer, my friend had an idea for a simple web app to sell some data that we could scrape. 
          Using all my knowledge, skills, and Google, I was able to develop and deploy this web app in under 10 hours. 
          This was huge for me; it was at this point that I realized I was good enough to build whatever I had in mind. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          My work term was coming to an end. In my final chat with my boss, he asked what I would be doing with my time off. 
          Not thinking much of it, I told him about my web development journey and how I planned to build a game that I came up with. 
          Out of nowhere, he asked if I wanted to get connected with one of his friends who would be interested in hiring someone with my skill set. CRAZY! 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Well, this wasn't my big break into tech. Funny enough, the work wasn't even coding/web development focused; it was in data analytics. 
          Regardless, everything I learned could be used to help solve problems and work with data more effectively.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          So, for the last four months of the year, I was back in school, I built two web-based games, and worked as a data analyst. 
          The games never took off, but I started working with more modern technology like SvelteKit, which is now my go to web framework! 
          In one of my classes, my professor let me use Python to analyze labour force survey data which was very fun. 
          It was through that class and my role as a data analyst I realized that analytics could be a great career path which combines all my skills.

          I loved web development, but not enough to make a career out of it. 
          At heart, I'm a business guy, and deep down I thought that getting a coding job would take the fun out it for me. 
          I enjoy using newer stacks, and I only care to build things that I find interesting. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          As I mentioned, analytics seemed like a great in-between spot to combine my technical and business skills. 
          So, from there I started targeting data analyst roles and teaching myself machine learning. 
          While machine learning is data science, I figured it would give me the edge up in my job hunt, and ChatGPT launched in Q4 of 2022 so I just had to see what the ML/AI rave was about!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          So where am I right now? Well, I'm in the process of signing on with SkipTheDishes as a Sales Data Analyst which I'll start in May! 
          It looks like I'm finally starting to enjoy the fruits of my labour, but the journey doesn't stop here!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          It was desperation and failure that pushed me to learn how to code, and I'm glad that I did. 
          In just over a year, I completely changed my career outlook, and I can now build whatever comes to mind. 
          I've always been a guy that's interested in asymmetric risk, and I don't believe the modern person can get any more leverage than this. 
          If you learn how to code, you can literally create things out of thin air which will never cease to amaze me.
